I am a first year CS PhD student at the University of Southern California, fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Vatsal Sharan](https://vatsalsharan.github.io/). I am broadly interested in the theory of machine learning, particularly to understand and improve the robustness and generalization of learning-based methods. 

Previously, I was a (remote) Visiting Researcher at CVPR Unit, ISI Kolkata, advised by Prof. [Umapada Pal](https://www.isical.ac.in/~umapada/) and Prof. [Saumik Bhattacharya](https://saumikb.github.io/), working on deep metric learning. 

Before that, I graduated from [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) with a bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering. For my joint bachelor thesis, I worked on generative adversarial network-based methods for compressive sensing MRI reconstruction, under the guidance of Prof. [Saumik Bhattacharya](https://saumikb.github.io/) and Prof. [PM Pradhan](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~ECE/Pyari_Mohan_Pradhan). I also interned at Northwestern University as an SN Bose Scholar in the summer of 2019.
