I am a Visiting Researcher at CVPR Unit, ISI Kolkata, advised by Prof. Umapada Pal and Prof. Saumik Bhattacharya. My research interests lie in machine learning and its computer vision and healthcare applications. I am interested in exploring the synergy of causal reasoning and representation learning to improve the data-efficiency, generalization, robustness, and explainability of machine learning methods.

Previously, I graduated from IIT Roorkee with a bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering. For my joint bachelor thesis, I worked on generative adversarial network-based methods for compressive sensing MRI reconstruction. I also interned at Northwestern University as an SN Bose Scholar in the summer of 2019.
